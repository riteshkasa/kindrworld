## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was actually started with our interest in books and helping the community. In high school, we struggled to find opportunities to volunteer in our community, and we wanted to give back to our communties. We hope that this project inspires others to make kind change.

## What it does
Our app connects students with volunteering opportunities in their area in a variety of their fields, and features a variety of tools to help you keep yourself accountable.

## How we built it
We used React Native and a MongoDB backend.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a variety of problems with react, as we're all new to web development. Particularly, there were a few backend issues which led to us having to scrap features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're happy to have a completed web app since none of us have made one before and we had little to no experience with web development!

## What we learned
We learned a lot of the fundamentals of React, and things like using APIs and using databases.

## What's next for KindrWorld
We want to expand KindrWorld to not be limited to just LA as well as implement the features we had to previously scrap such as a streak calendar and scraping volunteering opportunities to add to our MongoDB database.



This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
